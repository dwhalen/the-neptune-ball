The Neptune Ball presents interesting challenges for human guests, given that it is being held at King \cKing{\MYname{}}'s palace in Atlantis, 20,000 leagues under the sea.  

\subsection*{Amulets}
In order to attend the ball, you must have an amulet that allows you to breath under water. As a human, you start game with one of these amulets. Several characters may be able to fabricate new amulets, or alter existing amulets for a new purpose.

\subsection*{Drowning}
If you are ever separated from your amulet, you will begin to drown. While drowning, you cannot speak, although you can move freely. If you do not acquire an amulet within 10 minutes, you will die.
