\name{\gSpellBreak{}}

Many years ago, you were put under a spell by a powerful magician, \cWitch{}. You have been struggling under \cWitch{\his} control for quite some time, and have been steadily weakening the curse as time went on. Now the spell is on its last legs, and \cWitch{} is too distracted to properly strengthen it. This is your chance!

Each of the following actions you perform earns you 2 points towards breaking the spell. At 8 points, you are partially freed. 

Unless otherwise noted, no action can count twice.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Touch the trident for an uninterrupted 10 seconds.
\item Have a magician cast \aLesserDispel{} on you.
\item Drink a Healing Potion (red) when unhurt.
\item Talk to a human about the surface world for 3 minutes.
\item Meditate for 2 uninterrupted minutes out of the presence of \cWitch{}. This is repeatable, but only once every half hour.
\end{enumerate}

When you reach 8 points, the spell noticeably weakens. You are no longer compelled to do \cWitch{}'s bidding! But the spell is not fully broken. You still must do your honest best to prevent anyone from finding out any information about who ensorcelled you, and cannot knowingly cause \cWitch{\him} to come to harm. In order to break the second layer and reveal your former captor, you must complete the steps in the research notebook entitled \nSpellBreakNotebook{}. Open it to page 2.
