You love The \cExExKing{} Ball. It is an annual event of great beauty and culture. This year, your secret relationship with \cDiplomat{} has enamored you to the ball even more. So much so that you asked your \cKing{\parent} if you could help organize the ball. \cKing{} agreed to let you organize a dance showcase just before the banquet.

In order to make this the best, and most romantic ball ever, you've decided on an ambitious plan.  You want to have at least {\bf two couples} dance each of the {\bf three  kinds} of dance that you've heard of at the showcase.\\

The Three dances are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Merengue is the national dance of \pAtlantis{}.
\item Cross-step Waltz is the national dance of \pPacifica{}.
\item Swing is the national dance of \pAmerica{}.
\end{enumerate}

You need to get four or more people (two couples) to agree to perform. You {\bf may} be one of them. Unfortunately you don't know how to dance yet! 

You will have to get people to teach you, and to teach each other how to dance before the showcase.
