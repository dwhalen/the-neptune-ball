research notebook from locked chest

each step answers a chain of numbers.

5 locks

Return to the chest and try the combo. if it works, you may go on to the next step immediately, otherwise take a 15 minute penalty before you may go on. (scales up by 15 min every wrong answer.)

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sudoku  (research in a glowing book in the library)
\item Word scrambler  (translation of inscription on chest)
\item Number hunt  (series of runes that have appeared) 
\item word search to letters  (look for clues in paintings) - own copy but must remain in line of sight
\item Logic puzzle  (on the chest, last step)
\end{enumerate}
