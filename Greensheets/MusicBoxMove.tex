You have hidden the \iMusicBox{} in \sPacketA{\MYloc{}}. If you suspect that someone is trying to find the \iMusicBox{} and restore it, you will have to stop them. One way you can do this is by moving the \iMusicBox{}. Unfortunately you wont have a lot of time to do so, so it will become progressively more difficult. 

If you choose to move the \iMusicBox{} from one location to another, it must be moved in this order. (This is a kludge). If you want to move the box, you must first know where you are moving it to. You must find the next packet before you begin the process of moving the box. Since the box is two hands bulky and unstashable (except in the special packets), you must expedite transfer. You can't afford to be caught with the box.

You may use ``\aLesserDispel{}'' to {\bf break} the locks, but you may NOT use ``\aLesserDispel{}'' to assist in {\bf reinstalling} the magical locks.

{\bf To move the \iMusicBox{} from \sPacketA{\MYloc{}} to \sPacketB{\MYloc{}}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find ``\sPacketB{}'' in \sPacketB{\MYloc{}} so you know where you are moving the box to
  \item Go to ``\sPacketA{}'' and get a decking hand of 5 to break the magical locks you have placed on the box. 
  \item Take the \iMusicBox{} immediately to ``\sPacketB{}''. 
  \item Once the box is safely installed in ``\sPacketB{}'', get a decking hand of 3 to reinstall the magical locks.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf To move the \iMusicBox{} from \sPacketB{\MYloc{}} to \sPacketC{\MYloc{}}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find ``\sPacketC{}'' in \sPacketC{\MYloc{}} so you know where you are moving the box to
  \item Go to ``\sPacketB{}'' and get a decking hand of 4 to break the magical locks you have placed on the box. 
  \item Take the \iMusicBox{} immediately to ``\sPacketC{}''. 
  \item Once the box is safely installed in ``\sPacketC{}'', get a decking hand of 4 to reinstall the magical locks.
\end{enumerate}

{\bf To move the \iMusicBox{} from \sPacketC{\MYloc{}} to \sPacketD{\MYloc{}}}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Find ``\sPacketD{}'' in \sPacketD{\MYloc{}} so you know where you are moving the box to
  \item Go to ``\sPacketC{}'' and get a decking hand of 3 to break the magical locks you have placed on the box. 
  \item Take the \iMusicBox{} immediately to ``\sPacketD{}''. 
  \item Once the box is safely installed in ``\sPacketD{}'', get a decking hand of 4 to begin installing magical locks, you must get a {\bf second} decking hand of 4 to complete the reinstall of magical locks.
\end{enumerate}
