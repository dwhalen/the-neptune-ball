\name{\gAddicted{}}

You are addicted to \iDrug{}. It started as a small craving every now and again, but as time wore on, you found yourself craving it more and more. Every couple of hours you had to slip off for a smoke. So far you've managed to conceal this addiction from your parents, and you intend to keep it that way. To that end, you brought a small stash with you from the surface - what should have been enough to stave off the craving. However, chewing \iDrug{} is far less effective than smoking it, and you did not bring enough to get you through the entire trip. 

This afternoon, you started to feel the effects of your last dose fade. Driven to distraction, you were forced to break the promised radio silence with your dealer to arrange for more. To your surprise, he didn't seem angry - rather, it seemed almost like he expected you. He quickly prepared a list of questions he'd like you to find the answers to, and promised you doses in repayment.

You arranged to meet the dealer discreetly at \cTFifteen{\MYname{}}, \cTOneFifteen{\MYname{}}, \cTTwoFifteen{\MYname{}} and \cTThreeFifteen{\MYname{}} and pass the answers along to him. He will leave after 5 minutes, with or without his answers. \emph{See the mem-book ``Questions'' for mechanics of this interaction}.

You can feel the bite you took this afternoon fading. You will need to take additional hits throughout tonight - and your advance payment is down to a single dose.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Within 5 minutes of \cTFifteen{\MYname{}}, you must take 1 dose.
	\item Within 5 minutes of \cTOneFifteen{\MYname{}}, you must take 2 doses.
	\item Within 5 minutes of \cTTwoFifteen{\MYname{}}, you must take 2 doses.
	\item Within 5 minutes of \cTThreeFifteen{\MYname{}}, you must take 3 doses.
\end{enumerate}

If you don't get your doses on time, you start to experience withdrawal. Once you hit withdrawal, you go into a confused rage. You must make a knock out attack on the first person you see with your full CR. If you miss multiple doses, you must attack 1 new person for each missed dose. Once you have attacked as many people as doses you have missed, you must fall unconscious for 5 minutes. Withdrawal applies each hour you don't get your doses.

\iDrug{} has some positive effects and some negative effects. Immediately upon consumption, it will boost your CR by 1 for 10 minutes, but then it will reduce your base CR by 1 for the ten minutes following that. The buffs do not stack or cancel each other out.

{\bf N.B. If anyone in your family finds out about your addiction, give them the mem-packet related to this.}
