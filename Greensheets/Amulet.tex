Finishing \cAriel{}'s amulet should be trivial. You just need to:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the \sRunicCircle{}
\item Trace the circle in chalk
\item Spend 3 minutes in uninterrupted meditation with the shell amulet in your hands. 
\end{enumerate}

Once it is complete, things get a little tricker. You have to convince \cAriel{} that she can save \cAriel{\their} \cArielsSon{\offspring} by putting the amulet around her neck and wishing for \cArielsSon{\their} soul to be saved. This will trap \cAriel{} in the same kind of debt that you are trapped in. The spirits on the other side greatly appreciate new servants, and this will probably nullify much of your debts to the spirits - assuming she stays alive long enough to be useful to them. 

You should consider \cAriel{}'s debt to you resolved if you accomplish this.

If you get \cAriel{} to make this wish, give \cAriel{\them} your ``\mMEnvelope{\MYname}'' and tell \cAriel{\them} to open it.
