\name{\cPrince{}}

You are \cPrince{}, crown \cPrince{\Prince} of \pPacifica{} and heir to the throne. You rule your subjects with pride and want to protect them at all costs, which means getting this treaty signed above all else.

Born into opulence, you have enjoyed easy prosperity from an early age. Your \cPacificanRuler{\parent}, \cPacificanRuler{\King} \cPacificanRuler{} doted on you, but to you, that attention seemed smothering. Lessons in the art of diplomacy were difficult and taxing, but you relished the challenge – so you didn't take kindly to your mother’s worried attentions after every single lesson. Without a strict guiding hand, you became rebellious, and spent the majority of your free time sneaking out into the surrounding town to mingle with your common friends, and to take part in the commoner’s practice of dancing. Your mother didn't approve, worrying that you would pick up a disease or worse, be kidnapped – but you paid her no mind. What was the worst that could happen to a royal \cPrince{Prince}, beloved by the people?

In retrospect, perhaps you should have listened to your \cPacificanRuler{\Parent}. It wasn't long before the plague hit your circle of friends. While \ppolio{} was rocking the lower quarters of the capital, you were rocked along with it, contracting a severe case. Your \cPacificanRuler{\Parent} immediately sequestered you and began treatment, but not before the disease took a heavy toll on your health. Upon emerging from the palace after being given a clean bill of health, you returned to the lower quarters. You fully took in the devastation, and a little part of you died that day. Friends you had known and danced with all of your life had died in the streets as you had been being fanned and pampered in your royal bedroom, oblivious that anyone other than yourself had been suffering. You resolved that day to do everything in your power to bring the vaccine to \pPacifica{}, and to champion the cause of the marginalized from then on.

It didn't take you long to find a way to make good on your vow, though you knew the way would be challenging. Your chance came six months ago in the form of a wayward \cPrincess{\waif}. You apprehended \cPrincess{}, \cPrincess{\prince} of \pAtlantis{}, crossing the border while you were on a routine patrol. You brought \cPrincess{\them} back to the palace and interrogated \cPrincess{\them} -- gently, though. After all, \cPrincess{\they} was a \cPrincess{\Prince} -- fragile and beautiful. You couldn't get much out of \cPrincess{\them} -- \cPrincess{\they} didn't seem to know much -- until talk turned to \ppolio{}. You learned that \pAtlantis{} had a vaccine for \ppolio{}, thanks to their friendly association with humans. Here was your answer! You had to secure the vaccine for your people.  You sent \cPrincess{} back unharmed as a gesture of good faith, and immediately began drafting the treaty that you would propose. Things moved quickly after that, and sooner than even you expected, the trip to \pAtlantis{} was scheduled. You would leave within the month as head of the delegation.

You couldn't let this opportunity go to waste, and as such, your objectives were clear. First and foremost, you must secure the \ppolio{} vaccine.- The easiest way to do this would be to sign the treaty, but apparently humans will be attending the ball as well. Perhaps you could bridge the gap between your nations and they could help you directly? An additional benefit to signing the treaty, if you were lucky, would be to secure the \cPrincess{\Prince}'s hand in marriage -– after all, a political marriage could strengthen the treaty, as you made sure to include in your draft. \cPrincess{\Them} beauty was just a side benefit, of course.

On a more personal note, your studies of \pAtlantis{} have engendered a certain curiosity in you about their native dance forms. You had grown up dancing the waltz, but have read that \pAtlantis{} practices a different form of dance altogether. The provision in the treaty about open borders was your doing. While it isn’t quite as important as an end to the war or the vaccine, you’d really like to see your countries come together culturally by sharing your borders - –- starting with a dance lesson for the diplomats at the ball! If only you had a partner to help you teach!

\begin{itemz}[Goals]

	\item Protect all members of your delegation
