Where to begin? The beginning is so far in the past, it's hard to trace the convoluted path that has led you to this day. You guess it all began with \cExExKing{\King} \cExExKing{}, \cExExKing{\King} \cKing{}'s grand\cExExKing{\parent}, and your \cExExKing{\parent}. Although can you really call \cExExKing{\them} your \cExExKing{\parent}? \cExExKing{\They} never accepted you, never acknowledged you, never did anything for you.

\cExExKing{\They} was jealous of \pPacifica{} in every way. From the bounty of the harvests on the Central Pacific Basin, to the beauty of the kingdom's only \cMother{\prince}, your \cMother{\parent} \cMother{\MYname}. \cExExKing{} started a war over it. A war that devastated both \pPacifica{} and \pAtlantis{}. In the end, he got what he wanted though. His aggressive military tactics led to a breech in the castle wall, and the successful capture of your \cMother{\parent}. \cExExKing{} carried \cMother{\them} off, back to \pAtlantis{}, and by the time a successful counterattack was mounted to retrieve her, you had already been conceived.
