Where to begin? The beginning is so far in the past, it's hard to trace the convoluted path that has led you to this day. You guess it all began with \cExExKing{\King} \cExExKing{}, \cExExKing{\King} \cKing{}'s grand\cExExKing{\parent}, and your \cExExKing{\parent}. Although can you really call \cExExKing{\them} your \cExExKing{\parent}? \cExExKing{\They} never accepted you, never acknowledged you, never did anything for you.

\cExExKing{\They} was jealous of \pPacifica{} in every way. From the bounty of the harvests on the Central Pacific Basin, to the beauty of the kingdom's only \cMother{\prince}, your \cMother{\parent} \cMother{\MYname}. \cExExKing{} started a war over it. A war that devastated both \pPacifica{} and \pAtlantis{}. In the end, he got what he wanted though. His aggressive military tactics led to a breech in the castle wall, and the successful capture of your \cMother{\parent}. \cExExKing{} carried \cMother{\them} off, back to \pAtlantis{}, and by the time a successful counterattack was mounted to retrieve her, you had already been conceived.

Your \cMother{\parent} burned for revenge. \cMother{\Them} brothers wished to just kill the child and pretend as though you had never been. But your \cMother{\parent} was cleverer than they could ever hope to be, and persuaded \cMother{\them} brothers to spare your life, but put out the word that you had died.

And so you were raised in secret, at \pAssassin{} where you and your \cMother{\parent} were hidden away. The only thing that grew faster and stronger than you was your hatred of \pAtlantis{} and what \cExExKing{} had done to your \cMother{\parent}. Although your \cMother{\parent}'s seer's gift pass only through the female line, you were not without your own talents. From a young age, magic flowed in your veins, and you studied hard from the moment you could read.

At the age of 14, you set out on a quest to find the \iTriton{\MYname}. \cMother{} had a vision that the fate of both \pPacifica{} and \pAtlantis{} were intimately tied to it's fate, and despite your youth, you relished the chance to strike back at your \cExExKing{\parent}'s country. The search took you 20 years and seemed to be dogged by bitter tragedy. Your \cMother{} died, alone, while you were fighting for your life in the freezing waters of the Ross Sea. In the end it turned out to be a bad lead anyway. Your intelligence next led you to Atlantis. With a few words whispered in the right ears, you persuaded \pPacifica{} to attack the Angola plain of \pAtlantis{} by sneaking through the neutral kingdom of \pIndia{}. The operation gave you the perfect cover as you blended in with a group of \pAtlantis{}n refugees,
