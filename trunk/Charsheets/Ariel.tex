Your name is \cAriel{}. You are FILL IN AGE years old, and human. You are married to \cEric{}, and have a beautiful 12 year old \cWillow{\offspring}, \cWillow{}. You are also \pAtlantis{}'s eldest \cAriel{\prince}, and in big trouble.

16 years ago, you made a deal with \cWitch{}. You traded the promise of your firstborn \cArielsSon{\offspring}, for the chance at legs. At the time, it seemed like a fair trade. You were desperate to get to the human world, and since your \cKing{\parent}, \cKing{\King} \cKing{} strictly regulated contact with the human world, \cWitch{} was the only way.

Unfortunately for you, your success in wooing \cEric{} infuriated \cWitch{}, and \cWitch{\they} boiled up out of the ocean in an attempt to destroy you. Together, you, \cEric{} and \cEric{}'s \cPrince{\sibling} \cPrince{} defeated \cWitch{\them} at a heavy price, paying for her death with \cPrince{}'s life. Or so you thought.

Life on land went on though, and you and you and \cEric{} were married. With \cWitch{} dead, you had no fear for your possible children. You had a \cWillow{\offspring} a year later. On land you also learned that a cure exists for \cPolio{}. This crippling disease had begun to affect your merkin in the years before you left. The disease was not yet an epidemic when you left, but there was always that chance, since merfolk had no way to combat it. You worried about your homesea, but you were happy on land.

Well, except for the part where your \cKing{\parent} wont speak to you any more. \cKing{\They} forced you to cut ties with your entire family when you left the sea by disowning you. You miss them, but the happy family you remember from your childhood years was gone long before you left, lost along with your \cAthena{\parent} when you were FILL IN AGE. At least with \cEric{} you have a family with a \cEric{\parent} that didn't sink into endless depression. \cEric{} is there for \cWillow{} in a way that \cKing{} was {\bf never} there for you.

Despite being human, you retained your ability to communicate with ocean creatures. A few years ago, a seagull turned up outside your window with a fish in it's mouth. The fish relayed an urgent message from your contacts in \pAtlantis{}. (Despite your \cKing{\parent}'s best attempts to isolate you for the ``sake of \pAtlantis{}'', you had non-merfolk friends who still kept in touch) Word in the underground was that \cWitch{} had surfaced again, in disguise of course.  Suddenly the promise of your firstborn \cArielsSon{\offspring} stirred in you uneasily. It was nothing like the pleasant sensation of \cArielsSon{} kicking in the womb. Yes, you were pregnant again, this time with a \cArielsSon{\offspring}.

You immediately went to \cEric{} and told him everything that you had concealed from him for so many years.
