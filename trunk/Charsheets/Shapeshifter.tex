You are a shape-shifting general out to protect your family and your adopted homeland.

You were born on land to a single mother. You never knew your father growing up. You took one of the few paths open to you - the military. You joined up with the \pAmerica{}n army at the age of 15 to support your mother. Your strength and wit served you well, and you rose through the ranks. By the age of 25, you made drill sergeant. It was your job to train all of the new recruits. You did so well at that job that you were also named captain of the royal guard. This brought you in fairly close contact with the royal family. You struck up somewhat of a friendship with the king, and even beat him at chess occasionally.

When the royal twins were old enough, the unenviable job of training them in swordsmanship fell to you. The boys were a pair of royal brats -- at least at first. \cEric{} outgrew this quickly enough, but \cSlave{} never did take kindly to being ordered around. You are sure that you would have eventually turned both of them into stellar soldiers and leaders if the shipwreck hadn't cut your plans short.

It was a on an expedition to the Labrador Sea with the King that an icy storm sprung up. Despite the best efforts of the seasoned crew, the ship was smashed to pieces on the coast of Greenland. You were thrown into the numbingly cold water, and lost consciousness when a wave smashed you against a rock. Your last thought was ``This is it''.

And then you woke up. At the bottom of an underwater canyon. You were bewildered for few minutes as you tried to remember what happened. Were you dead? You didn't feel dead -- everything hurt. But you were under water. You could breathe under water and for some reason you had a tail. A tail instead of legs. You were a \cGeneral{\mer}! Eventually you got over the shock and went looking for your friends and the King.

It took you 2 days to find the shipwreck, and when you did, you were heartbroken. The ship had been battered to pieces, and there were clearly no survivors. You  weighed your options and realized that you couldn't go back to \pAmerica{} with gills and a tail. You were half fish now, and didn't know if you could change back. If you did return, you would probably be treated as a traitor. Merfolk occasionally attacked ships, and it was too convenient that you, a \cGeneral{\mer}, were the only survivor.

You reluctantly looted the ship for a few valuable items and set off in search of civilization. You found a military outpost of \pAtlantis{} in the Norwegian Sea, and traded the trinkets from the ship for a chance to earn the merfolk's trust.  The constant border skirmishes with \pPacifica{} gave you plenty of opportunity to master the use of a trident. Your military training from \pAmerica{} served you well, and you were soon a trusted member of the outpost. After about a year, they allowed you to officially join the Guardian's Guild, \pAtlantis{}'s military.

You enjoyed the company of your new brethren, and often went out to bars with them, despite the fact that you were almost twice the age of some of the new recruits. Every time you would go though, in just about every bar you went to, some drunk, or the bartender himself would tell you that you looked exactly like some old drunk who used to frequent the place. Eventually, you stopped dismissing the stories, and began to wonder if there might not be something to it. In particular, you wondered if this mysterious drunk might be your father.

You took a sabbatical from the Guardian's Guild to follow the trail of drunken stories. It was a convoluted trail, and nothing was ever concrete, at least until you reached the gates of a placial estate.
