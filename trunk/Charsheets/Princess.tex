\name{\cPrincess{}}

You are an \pAtlantis{}n \cPrincess{\prince} who loves \cPrincess{\them} \cKing{\parent}, \cPrincess{\them} country, and \cPrincess{\them} forbidden inamorato across the border in \pPacifica{}.

Born an \pAtlantis{}n \cPrincess{\prince}, your life should have been a dream. But you had to endure the pain of growing up without a \cQueen{\parent} for all these 23 years. You are told \cQueen{\they} left when you were two. It doesn't really matter though, because you don't remember \cQueen{\them} at all. Growing up, you often dreamed that your c\cQueen{\parent} was still alive, and would just turn up one day, and everything would be perfect. If only life were so sweet.

Growing up without a \cQueen{\parent} has been challenging, but you spent a lot of time with your \cPlant{\uncle} \cPlant{}, head of the Explorer's Guild. You may even be more fond of your \cPlant{\uncle} than of your own \cKing{\parent}, since \cPlant{} always made time for you. You don't care that everyone thinks \cPlant{\they}'s crazy. \cPlant{\Their} wild conspiracy theories are kind of endearing. And who knows, maybe \cPlant{\they}'s even right about some of them.

You might have been able to cope with your \cQueen{\parent} leaving you, if not for your \cAriel{\sibling} following \cQueen{\them} footsteps when you were 10. \cAriel{} left for the human world via the darkest of magic (according to your \cKing{\parent} anyway)). \cKing{\They} never really spoke of \cAriel{\them|} again, but you noticed he was taking higher doses of his medication after that.

Of course your \cKing{\parent} doesn't know that you know about them, but you've know for as long as you can remember that your \cKing{\parent} has been struggling with depression. You've made an effort to help \cKing{\them}, by covering for \cKing{\them} whenever possible, and trying to show \cKing{\them} that you at least care. You are very subtle about it though (for the sake of \cKing{\their} pride), and have so far avoided tipping \cKing{\them} off that you know anything about it.

But enough about your family, most of whom don't care about you. You spent many of your teenage years either cooped up in the castle, enduring stupid lessons about diplomacy, or out with the Explorer's Guild and your \cPlant{\uncle}. Although time away from the castle was nice, you really didn't have anyone you could really trust -- at least until you met \emph{\cDiplomat{\them}}.

You had gotten back late from an Explorer's Guild trip, and were making your way down to the kitchens for a late night snack when you literally ran into \emph{\cDiplomat{\them}}. Time stopped. You stared into each other's eyes for a heartbeat -- then two. You looked down shyly. You were grimy from a day of exploring, your bag still slung over one shoulder,and your jacket covered in mud. You tried to stammer out an apology at the same time as \cDiplomat{\they} did. After a moment, you recovered your poise and asked ``Would you like to join me in the garden?'' \cDiplomat{\They} said ``yes,'' and the rest was history.  It turned out that \cDiplomat{\they} was a \pPacifica{}n diplomat named \cDiplomat{}, and the two of you can't see enough of each other. 

You started taking an interest in politics as an excuse to try to see \cDiplomat{\them} more often. When that wasn't often enough, you started sneaking across the \pPacifica{}n border with your friend \cPriest{} from the Explorer's Guild. It didn't hurt that you were assisting in a noble cause. \cPriest{} has been working for years to find homes in \pPacifica{} for \pAtlantis{}n orphans.
