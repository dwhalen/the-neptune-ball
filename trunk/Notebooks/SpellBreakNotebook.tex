%% Research Notebooks live in this directory.  This file doubles as a
%% latex'able example notebook.
%%
%% Notebook macros (in ../Lists/notebook-LIST.tex, presumably) each
%% have a file that lives here.  The argument to \startnotebook{...}
%% probably should be the macro for the given whitesheet.  However,
%% you can also just use \name{Some Text} if you want.
%%
%% Note that every \startnotebook command needs a matching
%% \endnotebook command.  Also note that no ownership information
%% appears on the notebook.
