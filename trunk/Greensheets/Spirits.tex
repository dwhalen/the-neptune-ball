You are now a magician, level 1. Change your $\alpha$ score to 2.

As a magician, you have the ability to cast spells and make potions, but only up to your skill level. It is not possible within scope of game to increase your skill level. You know about many spells and potions, even those beyond your ability, thanks to the spirits\ldots{}

You are not a born magician, instead your power comes from the spirits \emph{on the other side}. While they are very powerful, and can allow you to do almost anything once you  learn to communicate with them, they extract a heavy price. You are already deeply in debt to them from the wish you made. You will have to pay them back someday, somehow. The full impact of this has not hit you yet, but you feel ill at ease, and angry at being tricked into this.
