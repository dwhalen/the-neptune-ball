Can spend 5 min in royal archives to open an item and find out where to search.

Search

\begin{enumerate}
\item How many major powers under the sea? (Three)  [easy]  (searching the archives gives you the answer)
\item Where is the Assassin's Guild? (The Bering strait) [med]  (told to search the pacifican embassy)
\item Who was the King of Atlantica when the war with Pacifica started? (Neptune) [med]  (searching the archives gives you the answer)
\item Among the Explorer's Guild, the Guardian's Guild, and the Merchant's Guild, which guild has the oldest current or most recent leader? (E/G/M) [hard] (find names from people, spend 30 seconds to look up ages) (otherwise takes 10 minutes to look up a name first.)
\item Between the patron animals of the \pPacifica{}n and the \pAtlantica{}n religions, which is the top predator? (Sperm Whale) [hard]
\item What is the name of the Province in which the \pPolio{} vaccine was developed? [impossible]
\item How many years ago was the last meeting of the Magician's Guild?[impossible]
\end{enumerate}

People can guess at any point, but take a 5 min penalty for getting it wrong. Whoever actually articulates the answer will get the stone.
