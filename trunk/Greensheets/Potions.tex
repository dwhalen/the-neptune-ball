\name{\gPotions{}}

The spells and potions a magician can use are based on their level. Spells are represented as ability cards and are used as instant abilities. All potions follow a standard brewing strategy (see below the list). Potions have distinctive colors and can be recognized by magicians by their color (Lay people don't know what color the different potions are). Potions are represented as item envelopes that can be obtained at the cauldrons where they are brewed. You cannot dump out or steal potions that you did not brew. (This is a kludge.)

Potions can be administered in 2 ways. A willing or helpless target can drink the potion, in which case, the person administering the potion should hand over the potion item envelope to the target. An ignorant target can also be injected with a potion. The person administering the potion must successfully stick a certain number of stickers on the target without being caught in the act, by the target or anyone else. (Stickers can be acquired at the cauldrons.) If the potion requires multiple dots to be effective, these dots must be applied at least 1 minute apart, but do not lose effect until the potion is applied. It does not matter if the stickers are noticed and removed before all are applied. Dots are out of game knowledge for anyone except for the player applying them. The person who is attempting to administer a potion should then find a GM, explain who the potion is targeting, and hand over the potion. The GM will handle the rest.

{\bf Each magician can only brew 2 potions at a time.} %%There will be 5 or 6 cauldrons (1 in banquet hall).

Here are the known spells and potions that may be useful this evening: %%MAKE ITEMS!!

{\bf How to Brew a Potion:}\\ %%MAKE SIGNS!!!
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Acquire the necessary ingredients.
  \item Stand in front of ``\sEmptyCauldron{}'' for 1 minute. At the end of this time, destroy the ingredients (they have been consumed by the potion), swap the cauldron sign to ``\sFullCauldron{}'' and write down the color of the potion you are brewing. If you are interrupted or otherwise cease to tend the potion before the 1 minute is up, you retain the items.
  \item Return after the duration listed above. (Potions cannot over brew) If the potion is the Deadly Poison, spend 1 minute adding the additional ingredients at this time.
  \item Take the appropriate potion from the envelope below the cauldron, erase the color, and swap the sign back to ``\sEmptyCauldron{}''.
\end{enumerate}


{\bf Dangerous Ingredients:}
Some ingredients are never meant for beneficial or benign potions. 
\begin{enumerate}
