You have hidden the \iMusicBox{} in \sPacketA{\myLoc}. If you suspect that someone is trying to find the \iMusicBox{} and restore it, you will have to stop them. One way you can do this is by moving the \iMusicBox{}. Unfortunately you wont have a lot of time to do so, so it will become progressively more difficult. 

You must move the \iMusicBox{} from one location to another, it must be moved in this order. (This is a kludge). If you want to move the box, you must first know where you are moving it to. You must find the next packet before you begin the process of moving the box. Since the box is one hand bulky and unstashable (except in the special packets), you must expedite transfer. You can't afford to be seen with the box

To move the \iMusicBox{} from \sPacketA{\myLoc} to \sPacketB{\myLoc}, find ``\sPacketB{}'' in \sPacketB{\myLoc} so you know where you are moving the box to, then go to ``\sPacketA{}'' and get a decking hand of 4 to break the magical locks you have placed on the box. Take the \iMusicBox{} immediately to ``\sPacketB{}''. You cannot keep the box on your person for very long as it is one hand bulky and unstashable. You'd be hard pressed to explain
