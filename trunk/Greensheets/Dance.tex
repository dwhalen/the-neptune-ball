You love The \cExExKing{} Ball. It is an annual event of great beauty and culture. This year, your secret relationship with \cDiplomat{} has enamored you to the ball even more. So much so that you asked your \cKing{\parent} if you could help organize the ball. \cKing{} agreed to let you organize a dance showcase just before the banquet.

In order to make this the best, and most romantic ball ever, you've decided on an ambitious plan.  You want to have at least {\bf two couples} dance each of the {\bf three  kinds} of dance that you've heard of.\\

Merengue is the national dance of \pAtlantis{}.\\
Cross-step Waltz is the national dance of \pPacifica{}.\\
Swing is the national dance of \pAmerica{}.\\

You'd love to be one of the dancers performing, but unfortunately you don't know how to dance yet! You will have to get people to teach you, and to teach each other how to dance before the showcase.
